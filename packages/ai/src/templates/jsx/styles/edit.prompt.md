Given the JSX and CSS above, your task is to rewrite some or all the styles in order to fulfill the following edit request:

```
{prompt-content}
```

Use the following rules:

- Be creative and provide innovative design: styles should produce a high-end and aesthetically pleasing result.
- Only output a valid CSS code block and no other text.
- The CSS must be minified and therefore you must avoid indentation and new lines.
- Preserve the CSS above that does not need changes.
- For each `className` that needs changes generate corresponding vanilla CSS.
- Don't assume any styles are inherited and don't generate any global styles.
- Don't use CSS comments.
- Don't use shorthand CSS properties: generate CSS using longhand properties only.
- When generating colors use hex or rgb(a).
